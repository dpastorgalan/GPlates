# **Hello reader!**

This is my GPlates repository. Here I will post my ~~always right~~ rotation files, poligons and paleogepgraphy files ready to use and modify (**especially modify**).

In general terms I try to comment as much as possible every rotation, but sometimes you will find some ~~ridiculous~~ not easy to understand comment. If that is the case, probably you are facing some self-joke about the reconstruction, do not hesitate if you do not know why and where the rotation is coming from (*probably my imagination*).
